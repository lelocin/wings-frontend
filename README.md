# Wings of Sound Frontend React App
Wings of Sound is a venue-finding application for artists to discover venue spaces in New York to host performances. Through our frontend app, users can search venues based on filters like venue capacity, venue location and venue style to find their ideal venue. 

## Design decisions & technical choices 

## Components 
Our react app has three components, which are header, filter and results. 
1. Header: the header section provides space to explain what Wings of Sound is
