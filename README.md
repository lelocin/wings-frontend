## Design decisions & technical choices 
We consolidated all components onto a single page for simplicity. To give the landing page a professional look, we used a full page image. Overall, our frontend design prioritizes a smooth and user-friendly experience, with dropdown menus and search bars that enable quick and easy access to information.

## Components 
Our react app has three components, which are header, filter and results. 
1. Header: the header section provides space to explain what Wings of Sound is 
2. Filter: the filter section allows users to search using filters (dropdown menus and search bars)
3. Results: the results section displays results from the filter section and provides users with basic information of the venue
